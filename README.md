Overview
--------

WizarDroid is a lightweight Android library, developed by CodePond.org, that addresses a feature that Android is surprisingly missing, Wizards. It is built on top of Android's Fragments, using FragmentManager to dynamically change the view. Implementation is done mainly by extending __WizardFragment__ class.

Key advantages:

* Compatible with other libraries such as [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/)
* Support for nested fragments
* Wizard's flow is defined in one place and can be maintained easily
* Step context is persistent and passed between steps automatically using reflection
* Simple API for controlling wizard's flow in runtime 


More info is available on WizarDroid [home page](http://wizardroid.codepond.org).
